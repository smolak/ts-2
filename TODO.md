## Performance Monitoring

### getUserFeed Query Performance
- [ ] Add query timing logs to measure actual performance improvement
  - Measure execution time before/after optimizations
  - Track query performance in production
  - Monitor cache hit/miss rates if implementing Redis caching
  - Consider adding APM (Application Performance Monitoring) integration
  - Target: <50ms for cold queries, <5ms for cached queries
- [ ] Rename *DTO to *Dto, e.g. FeedDTO -> FeedDto
